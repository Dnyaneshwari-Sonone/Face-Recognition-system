# Face-Recognition-system
Detection and Identification of facial images


Our system mainly focuses on:
1. Extraction of facial parts from a given image.
2. Matching of the extracted face with the most resembling face from the dataset (Face recognition).

Violaâ€“Jones object detection framework has been used for detection and extraction of the facial part from an image.
Eigenface approach has been used for face recognition.
